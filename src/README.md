## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |

## Validation Rules

The signup endpoint enforces the following validations:

1. **Email Domain**: Only emails with `@mergington.edu` domain are allowed
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Students cannot sign up for the same activity twice
3. **Capacity Limit**: Activities cannot exceed their maximum participant limit
4. **Activity Existence**: The activity must exist in the system

All validation errors return HTTP 400 status with descriptive error messages.

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
